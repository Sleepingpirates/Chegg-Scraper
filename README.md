# About scraper 

All this is wrapped into a discord bot. When a command through discord with a url of the chegg question is issued the bot uses puppeteer automation to login into chegg and scrape the answer into a nicely formated html file and is sent back to the users direct message in discord.  

This script uses multiple ways to avoid bot detection and works almost all the time when combined with a residential proxy. And for the times it fails, it automatically solves captcha using 2captcha.
